2010-12-12
1.   * Items will now properly grant stats. StatsCount is not included in the cache, but is required by CactusEMU. Hackfix to set StatsCount to 10.
     * .01 implies a minor fix.
	 
2010-12-18
1.	 * 2.1 release. For a list of requirements per milestone see http://wiki.cactusemu.com/index.php?title=DB_Milestones.
     - Introduced roughly 5000 new quests.
     - Removed quests that no longer exist from all types of questgivers
     - Added a real fix for StatsCount on items
     * These may or may not be correct. Ive spent alot of time on these, but my laptop with WoW on it died, 
	    so I havent had the chance to test them myself. Please report bugs you may find.

1.   Thanks to Silinoron who added the new Cata fields to the quest_template
