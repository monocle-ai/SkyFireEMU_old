TODO (add new things to sort out here) :
* Core:
    - Fix Grouping to not port players off bf, this is an open match not a forced raid.
	- Move spawns to database : NPCs / GOs (DB part mostly done, core needs to be adjusted)
    - Fix teleport spells for vehicles/drivers
    - Clean up code to use phases-system / spells instead of hardcoded spawn/despawn functionality
    - Remove hardcoded entities from headerfile
    - Spawn horde/alliance spiritguides spawn/change depending on holder
    - Clean up some minor hacks

* DB:

	- Template updates for npcs and GOs (few missing)
    - Npc 30488 (Travis Day) needs vendor data
    - Get official texts for horde in db
    - Spawn NPC/GO in their correct phase

COMPLETED (move completed things from the above list here) :
    - Adjust SQL structures to fit SkyFireDB
